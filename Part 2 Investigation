## **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a detailed investigation into the automated bot activity within Roblox. The focus is on identifying the models these bots use for **chat automation**, **in-game actions**, and the involvement of third-party websites like **Luger.GG** in facilitating their operation. Our research shows that these bots are capable of **autofarming**, performing **human-like actions**, and engaging in conversations, but with distinct limitations that suggest they are using pre-programmed scripts or external machine-learning models. Furthermore, we suspect that these bots are connected to the **Roblox black market**, contributing to scams and fraudulent transactions involving in-game assets and currency.

## **4. Key Findings**

### **4.1 Bot Models and Operational Mechanics**

#### **4.1.1 Chat Automation Models**:

- **Pre-Programmed Scripts**:  
  The bots often use **pre-programmed scripts** for basic chat interactions. They respond to simple queries or commands but fail to engage in more complex or varied conversations. This behavior is common among bots that rely on **template-based responses**. For example:
  - **Common Phrases**: "How can I help you?", "I am a friendly bot!", "Welcome to Roblox!", etc.
  - **Limited Dynamic Interaction**: These bots cannot answer open-ended or personalized questions an
